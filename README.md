Note: This version of the Lockheed L-188 now requires Rembrant be enabled for the instruments to all function properly.

Our thanks to MD-VP for providing a well-designed platform of the Lockheed L-188 Electra.  It has made our work easier as we have continued the development of this aircraft that has had such a prominent role in aviation history, both in commercial and military applications.  Even though it was initially conceived in the mid-1950s, (first flight 6 Dec 1957) there are several dozen original airframes still in use.  A total of 170 Electras were built.  This plane should not be confused with Lockheed's earlier Model 10 Electra, a twin engine aircraft infamous for Amelia Earhart's tragic attempt to fly around the globe.  

The L-188 is equipped with four Allison T56 501-D13 turboprop engines rated at 3750 estimated shaft horse power each. The T56, notably is also used in the Lockheed C-130.  The T56 is a constant rotating turboshaft engine at 13,820 RPM.  Because no propeller can spin at this rate, it is geared down by about 13:1 to 1106 RPM and uses variable pitch propellers to control its speed.

According to company records, the initial problems the engines had with noise, sympathetic vibrations, not only caused passenger discomfort during climb, but were implicated in a number of fatal crashes.  They foound this was was due to the engine cowling being placed at such an angle that it caused the engine mounting bolts to shear.  The problem was addressed by adjusting the cowling 3 degrees, changing the flow of the air flow so it became much more smooth.  After that, the L-188's safety record improved significantly.

The Allison 501-D13 engines (originally part of General Motors but now owned by Rolls Royce) have proven to be one of the most reliable power plants ever developed and are used not only for aviation applications but also are used in to power ship generators.

Additionally, the plane was the template for the P-3 Orion (first flight, 1959), a submarine hunter which is used by numerous countries and is expected to remain in service for years to come.

Changes-----

Braiff International Airways introduced its "Flying Colors" livery in 1970. They cleverly touted it as "The end of the Plain Plane: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3_aNtQFsLk.

Here is the image of the livery taken from their archives:

I have been working on the project in two stages.  First, the instrument panel needed to be populated.  I've attempted to set up the panel using photos of many different Electra flightdecks to represent what a typical arrangement would be presented.  Since the aircraft does not have a First Officer position, I elected not to create instruments there.

The second stage is the engines.  IAHM-COL and I have done some prelimiminary work in preparation to converting the Pratt and Withney Double Wasp piston engines to the Allisons, but as of this date (28 Jan 2016) those changes have not been pushed to this fork.  The issue is that we do not yet have an Allison T56 XML engine file built yet, nor the Nasal file rewritten.

However, when I changed the sound files from the piston engine to the turboprop files, I discovered that the throttle response actually is far more sensitive and the engines appear to have more power.

The other minor change I made is I have increased the turning radius of the nose wheel so the plane can make tighter turns while taxiing.
